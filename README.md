# odin-etch-a-sketch

The aim of this project is to practice my CSS Flexbox skills with a mix of DOM manipulation that depends on user input.

The development of this project will be broken down into several phases:

1) Planning Phase: Sketch out the UI design of the webpage and predict what functions are required to achieve interaction between the user and the interphace.

2) Design Phase: Write the HTML and CSS behind the design of the webpage.

3) Coding Phase: Write the JS script that achieves the interaction between the UI and the user.
